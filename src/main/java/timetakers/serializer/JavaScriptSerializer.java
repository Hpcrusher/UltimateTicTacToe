     * This CharacterEscapes implementation makes sure that the slash ('/') and ampersand ('&') characters
     * are also escaped, which is not standard Jackson behaviour.
     *
     * Escaping '/' covers against the possible premature closing of <script> tags inside inlined JavaScript
     * literals, thus preventing code injection in templates being processed by browsers as HTML.
     *
     * Escaping '&' covers against the injection of XHTML-escaped code which might prematurely close the
     * inlined JavaScript literals and even the container <script> tags in templates being processed
     * by browsers as XHTML.
     *
     * Note that, unfortunately Jackson's escape customization mechanism offers no way to only escape '/' when it
     * is preceded by '<', so that only '</' is escaped. Therefore, all '/' need to be escaped. Which is a
     * difference with the default Unbescape-based mechanism.
